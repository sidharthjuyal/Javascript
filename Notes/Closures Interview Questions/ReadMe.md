# üìò CRAZY JS INTERVIEW ü§Ø ft. Closures

## üîç 1. Famous Closure Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is a closure?
A **closure** is a function paired with its **lexical environment**, meaning it can access variables from its outer scope even after that outer function has finished.
```js
function outer() {
  var a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // logs 10
````

---

### Q2: Does order matter?
No. Even if you declare the variable after the inner function:
```js
function outer() {
  function inner() { console.log(a); }
  var a = 10;
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // still logs 10
```

---

### Q3: `const` or `let` instead of `var`?
Doesn't matter‚Äîclosures work the same way:
```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() { console.log(a); }
  return inner;
}
outer()(); // logs 10
```

---

### Q4: Arguments are captured too?
Yes! Closures include function parameters:
```js
function outer(str) {
  let a = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(a, str);
  }
  return inner;
}
outer('hi')(); // logs 10, "hi"
```

---

### Q5: Multiple nested layers?
Closures can reach all the way up the chain:
```js
function outest() {
  var c = 20;
  function outer(str) {
    let a = 10;
    function inner() {
      console.log(a, c, str);
    }
    return inner;
  }
  return outer;
}
outest()('hi')(); // logs 10, 20, "hi"
```

---

### Q6: What if global variables shadow inner names?

Inner scope always wins unless it's missing:
```js
let a = 100;
outest()('hello')(); // still logs 10 ‚Äî inner `a` shadows global
```

---

## üß© 2. Why Closures Matter
* **Data hiding & encapsulation**: variables live only inside your function.
  ``` js
  // Constructor Function
  function Counter() {
     let count = 0;
     this.incrementCounter() {
        count++;
        console.log(count);
     }
     this.deccrementCounter() {
        count--;
        console.log(count);
     }
  }

  var counter1 = new Counter();
  counter1().incrementCounter;  // 1
  counter1().incrementCounter;  // 2
  counter1().decrementCounter;  // 1

  var counter2 = counter();  // created fresh new counter
  counter2().incrementCounter; // 1 
  ```
* **Module pattern, currying, memoization**: closures keep state alive.
* **Event handlers, timers**: let functions remember data after outer execution.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Memory & Garbage Collection
* Closures **hold references to outer variables**, which prevents them from being garbage-collected.
* If misused, this can cause **memory leaks** or bloated memory usage. (can also freeze the browser)
* Modern JS engines are optimized to clean up unused closures, but awareness is key.

---

### üóëÔ∏è What is Garbage Collection in JavaScript?
**Garbage Collection (GC)** is the process by which the JavaScript engine automatically frees up memory that's no longer in use ‚Äî i.e., memory that is no longer **reachable**.

---

### üß† How It Works:
- JS uses a mechanism called **Mark-and-Sweep**:
  - The engine starts from the **root** (like global objects).
  - It recursively marks all **reachable values** (variables, objects, functions).
  - Any value **not marked** (unreachable from any live reference) is considered **garbage** and is **deleted** from memory.

---

### üîÅ Closures & GC:
- Closures keep variables **alive** by maintaining references.
- If a closure is **still accessible** (e.g., via an event listener or timeout), its captured variables **won‚Äôt be garbage collected**.
- Once there are **no references** to a closure (and thus no reference to its environment), **GC kicks in**.

---

### ‚úÖ Example:
```js
function outer() {
  let a = 10;
  return function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  };
}
const fn = outer(); // closure created, `a` is still in memory
// If `fn` is later set to null ‚Üí closure + `a` becomes unreachable ‚Üí GC clears it
````

### üö® Why This Matters:
* Preventing **memory leaks** in long-running apps.
* Understanding how closures can **retain memory longer than expected**.
* Writing more **optimized**, **leak-free** JavaScript.

| Concept                       | Details                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Closure**                   | Function + captured lexical environment                          |
| **Order**                     | Declaration order doesn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî closures capture by reference |
| **Scoping (`var/let/const`)** | All work fine; closure depends on lexical placement, not type    |
| **Parameters**                | Also captured inside closures                                    |
| **Nested closures**           | Able to access from multiple nested scopes                       |
| **Shadowing**                 | Inner variables take precedence over outer ones                  |
| **Memory impact**             | Variables in closure aren‚Äôt freed until function is out of scope |
